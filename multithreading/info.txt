Thread Class vs Runnable Interface

1.  If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other
class because Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance.
But, if we implement the Runnable interface, our class can
still extend other base classes.


2.  We can achieve basic functionality of a thread by extending Thread class because
it provides some inbuilt methods like yield(), interrupt() etc. that are not
available in Runnable interface.


3.  Using runnable will give you an object that can be shared amongst multiple threads.


"""Advantage of Thread-based Multitasking over Process-Thread Multitasking"""
The main advantages of thread-based multitasking as compared to process-based tasking are

1. Threads share the same memory address space.

2. Context switching from one thread to another thread is less expensive than between processes.

3. The cost of communication between threads is relatively low.

4. Threads are lightweight as compared to processes (heavyweight). They utilize the minimum resources of the system.
They take less memory and less processor time.
